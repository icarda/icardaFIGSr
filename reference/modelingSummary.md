# Get modeling metrics

modelingSummary is an automatic function for modeling data, it returns a
dataframe containing the metrics of the modeling using five machine
learning algorithms: KNN, SVM, RF, NNET, and Bcart. This function is
based on spliData, tuneTrain, predict, and getMetrics functions.

## Usage

``` r
modelingSummary(
  data,
  y,
  p = 0.7,
  length = 10,
  control = "repeatedcv",
  number = 10,
  repeats = 10,
  process = c("center", "scale"),
  summary = multiClassSummary,
  positive,
  parallelComputing = FALSE,
  classtype,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  object of class "data.frame" with target variable and predictor
  variables.

- y:

  character. Target variable.

- p:

  numeric. Proportion of data to be used for training. Default: 0.7

- length:

  integer. Number of values to output for each tuning parameter. If
  `search = "random"` is passed to
  [`trainControl`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/caret/man/trainControl.html)
  through `...`, this becomes the maximum number of tuning parameter
  combinations that are generated by the random search. Default: 10.

- control:

  character. Resampling method to use. Choices include: "boot",
  "boot632", "optimism_boot", "boot_all", "cv", "repeatedcv", "LOOCV",
  "LGOCV", "none", "oob", timeslice, "adaptive_cv", "adaptive_boot", or
  "adaptive_LGOCV". Default: "repeatedcv". See
  [`train`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/caret/man/train.html) for specific
  details on the resampling methods.

- number:

  integer. Number of cross-validation folds or number of resampling
  iterations. Default: 10.

- repeats:

  integer. Number of folds for repeated k-fold cross-validation if
  "repeatedcv" is chosen as the resampling method in `control`. Default:
  10.

- process:

  character. Defines the pre-processing transformation of predictor
  variables to be done. Options are: "BoxCox", "YeoJohnson",
  "expoTrans", "center", "scale", "range", "knnImpute", "bagImpute",
  "medianImpute", "pca", "ica", or "spatialSign". See
  [`preProcess`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/caret/man/preProcess.html) for
  specific details on each pre-processing transformation. Default:
  c('center', 'scale').

- summary:

  expression. Computes performance metrics across resamples. For numeric
  `y`, the mean squared error and R-squared are calculated. For factor
  `y`, the overall accuracy and Kappa are calculated. See
  [`trainControl`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/caret/man/trainControl.html) and
  [`defaultSummary`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/caret/man/postResample.html)
  for details on specification and summary options. Default:
  multiClassSummary.

- positive:

  character. The positive class for the target variable if `y` is
  factor. Usually, it is the first level of the factor.

- parallelComputing:

  logical. indicates whether to also use the parallel processing.
  Default: False

- classtype:

  integer.indicates the number of classes of the traits.

- ...:

  additional arguments to be passed to `createDataPartition`,
  `trainControl` and `train` functions in the package `caret`.

## Value

A dataframe contains the metrics of the modeling of five machine
learning algorithms: KNN, SVM, RF, NNET, and Bcart.

`tuneTrain` relies on package `caret` to perform the modeling.

## Details

Types of classification and regression models available for use with
`tuneTrain` can be found using `names(getModelInfo())`. The results
given depend on the type of model used.
